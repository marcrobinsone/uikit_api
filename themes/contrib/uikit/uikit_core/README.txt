INTRODUCTION
------------

The UIkit theme is a lightweight frontend framework with a comprehensive
collection of HTML, CSS, and JS components. It is a great alternative to other
frontend frameworks, plus is very lightweight and provides a lot of useful tools
for customizing with very little requirements.

   https://drupal.org/project/uikit

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The theme settings can be found at admin/appearance/settings/uikit. Each UIkit
component has its own settings, as well as many settings to control the
behavior of Drupal core components. As the development of this theme continues,
more settings will be added through updates.
